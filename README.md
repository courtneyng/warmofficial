Website for our mental health awareness game "Warm"

Currently on hiatus.

Made for ourselves and for our Girls Who Code(GWC) program with AT&T in 2018.
We had made a small demo in scratch that we were going to take to unity. Due to our limited knowledge
and time contraint we wanted to make a website to showcase a little bit about ourselves and what mental health 
means to us.
